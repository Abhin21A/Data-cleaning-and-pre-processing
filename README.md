# Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 

This project is part of an AI & ML Internship Task 1, where we perform basic **data cleaning and preprocessing** on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to prepare the raw dataset for machine learning model training.

## Objective
To learn and apply fundamental data preprocessing steps such as:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Basic data exploration

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

##  Dataset
Dataset used: [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)  
File: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`

##  Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps
- Dropped irrelevant columns: `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`, `PassengerId`
- Filled missing values in `Age` with median
- Filled missing values in `Embarked` with mode
- Converted `Sex` column using label encoding
- One-hot encoded the `Embarked` column
- Printed sample of cleaned data

##  Output
The cleaned dataset is ready for model training and evaluation.

##  Files Included
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
- `titanic_cleaning.ipynb`
- `README.md`
